### Learning Objectives

- Be able to use a variety of event listener types
- Be able to access values from form inputs on submit
- Be able to attach events to a variety of DOM elements
- Be able to read and write to the DOM

## Brief

Your task is to create a Reading List app that allow a user to submit items they intend to read later and view them on the page. 

### MVP

The html should have the following fields:

1. Title - text input
2. Author - text input
3. Category (e.g. book, article, blog post) - select

Once the user has submitted the form, the reading list item's details should be displayed below and the form's fields should reset to empty. Each time the user submits the form, the new reading list item should be added to the display.


### Extensions

1. Add a delete all button, that clears the list of submitted reading list items.
2. Add flexbox layout to the reading list so that items are displayed in a responsive grid.
